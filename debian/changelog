  * debian/fix-fltk-targets: Report command lines, which are now dynamic.
    (See debian/rules changes below.)
  * debian/libfltk*.symbols*: Accommodate LTO builds, which drop some
    symbols (none of which anything in the archive uses AFAICT).
    Specifically, pull out libfltk*.symbols.no-lto files and include them
    with the "(optional)" tag.  (Closes: #1015406.)
  * debian/**lintian-overrides: Add wildcards to accommodate pointed hints.
  * debian/rules:
    - Unhardcode path to stock FLTK-Targets(-none).cmake.
      Per https://gitlab.kitware.com/cmake/cmake/-/issues/23883,
      CMakeTmp/CMakeFiles/Export's subdirectory names are hexadecimal MD5
      hash values as of CMake 3.24; automatic detection allows backports
      to keep working and accommodates possible future layout changes.
      (Closes: #1017271.)
    - Inventory the final FLTK-Targets(-none).cmake files' add_* calls,
      automatically catching blatant problems and making some potential
      others immediately visible in build logs.
  * documentation/Makefile: Use English ("C") month names for PDF date.
    (Closes: #1017421.)
  * Standards-Version: 4.6.1 (routine-update)

fltk1.3 (1.3.8-4) unstable; urgency=medium

  * debian/copyright: Update years and png authors.  (NB: Debian still
    doesn't use that tree, or FLTK's other convenience library copies.)
  * CMake/UseFLTK.cmake.in: Drop include_directories setting, which has
    never been useful for package builds.  It historically wound up
    listing the standard system directory /usr/include, and now lists the
    build directory and a subdirectory thereof, harming reproducibility
    and breaking multiarch coinstallability for libfltk1.3-dev.

fltk1.3 (1.3.8-3) unstable; urgency=medium

  * debian/rules: More fltk-config handling cleanups, now fixing builds
    covering only architecture-independent binary packages.
    - Remove debian/tmp/usr/bin/fltk-config from
      override_dh_auto_install-indep, not just ...-arch.
    - Retire override_dh_install-arch, now superfluous even in full builds.

fltk1.3 (1.3.8-2) unstable; urgency=medium

  * debian/rules: Don't count on debian/tmp/usr/bin/fltk-config.  In
    particular, in builds that cover only architecture-dependent binary
    packages, override_dh_auto_install-indep won't recreate the file
    between override_dh_auto_install-arch and override_dh_install-arch.

fltk1.3 (1.3.8-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  [ Aaron M. Ucko ]
  * New upstream release.
  * debian/FLTK-Targets-head.cmake: New, to obtain DEB_HOST_MULTIARCH from
    dpkg-architecture.
  * debian/{FLTK-Targets-none-tail.cmake,fix-fltk-targets}: Split up
    fix-fltk-targets-none.
  * debian/control:
    - Have libfltk1.3-dev depend on dpkg-dev for dpkg-architecture.
    - Make libfltk1.3-dev multi-arch: same, as enabled by other changes in
      this Debian release.  (Closes: #1002579).
    - Stop worrying about Doxygen-unfriendly old texlive-latex-extra versions.
    - Standards-Version: 4.6.0 (already compliant).
  * debian/fix-fltk-targets: Substitute ${DEB_HOST_MULTIARCH} for the
    architecture-specific value.
  * debian/libfltk1.3.symbols: Add the one new symbol.
  * debian/rules:
    - Extend fix-fltk-targets to FLTK-Targets.cmake, just without the
      additional fragment.
    - For CMake, disable FLTK_BUILD_TEST rather than the deprecated
      OPTION_BUILD_EXAMPLES.
    - Supply a symlink to fltk-config's man page corresponding to its
      architecture-prefixed name.
    - Prepend FLTK-Targets-head.cmake to FLTK-Targets.cmake.
    - Ensure makeinclude always sets USEMMFILES (to No).
  * documentation/Makefile: Drop broken shell FLTK_VERSION setting.  (We
    already have and use a perfectly good makefile setting, whereas the
    shell setting derived from a file that changed names.)

  [ Dima Kogan ]
  * Arrange to install upstream's fltk-config with a GNU-tuple-prefixed
    name; substitute a wrapper that consults dpkg-architecture.

  * Trim trailing whitespace.
  * debian/copyright: use spaces rather than tabs to start continuation lines.
  * Use secure URI in Homepage field and debian/watch.
  * Set debhelper-compat version in Build-Depends.
  * Use AC_PATH_TOOL for upstream's manual PKGCONFIG setting.
    (PKG_PROG_PKG_CONFIG sets PKG_CONFIG instead.)
  * debian/libfltk1.3-dev.NEWS: Retire (gratuitous carryover from fltk1.1).
  * debian/fluid.NEWS: Keep, but reformat without leading asterisks.
  * Override notable Lintian false positives (fake CMakeCache.txt to satisfy
    FindFLTK.cmake, linkage of libc-independent libfltk_cairo.so.1.3).

fltk1.3 (1.3.5-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * New upstream release.
  * debian/compat: Advance to Debhelper 13.
  * debian/control:
    - Build-Depends: Advance minimum debhelper version to 13~ accordingly;
      swap transitional libgl1-mesa-dev package with formerly virtual
      libgl-dev package.
    - libfltk1.3-dev Recommends: Bypass libgl1-mesa-dev altogether.
    - Standards-Version: 4.5.0 (already compliant).
  * debian/copyright: Update years.
  * debian/fltk1.3-doc.lintian-overrides: Drop (thanks to #736360).
  * debian/libfltk1.3-compat-headers.install: Add new FL/platform.h.
  * debian/libfltk-gl1.3.symbols: Add the one new symbol.
  * debian/rules: Retire configure.saved business, no longer needed AFAICT.

fltk1.3 (1.3.4-10) unstable; urgency=medium

  [ Gianfranco Costamagna ]
  * Explicitly install CHANGES file, to avoid confusion
    and build failures when debhelper doesn't install changelogs
    by default (e.g. Ubuntu).  (MR: !1.)

  [ Aaron M. Ucko ]
  * debian/compat: Advance to Debhelper 12, notably yielding DWZ-compressed
    symbols and fully uncompressed examples.
  * debian/control:
     - Advance minimum debhelper version to 12~ accordingly.
     - Standards-Version: 4.4.1 (already compliant).
  * debian/fltk1.3-doc.docs: Take over coverage of fltk.pdf (available
    nowadays with the correct name and freshly generated contents).
  * debian/fltk1.3-doc.install: Take over coverage of HTML docs.
  * debian/rules:
    - Stop running "make install" in documentation/ to avoid populating
      debian/tmp/usr/share/man with uncompressed man and cat(!)  pages
      (about which dh_missing otherwise now complains); also stop
      explicitly (re)installing fltk.pdf.
    - Explicitly ignore usr/include/Fl (deliberately dropped, even in
      libfltk1.3-compat-headers) to address one last dh_missing complaint.
    - Stop explicitly running dh_makeshlibs -V, redundant as of DH 12.
  * documentation/make_pdf: Loosen caption de-hyperlinking to
    accommodate (but not require) interposed mboxes, as produced by Doxygen
    1.8.16 (currently in experimental).
  * documentation/src/fltk-book.tex.in: Explicitly \usepackage{ifthen} for
    the sake of several constructs in doxygen.sty, which has just a
    commented-out \RequirePackage call for it as of 1.8.16.  (Together with
    the above, closes: #943426.)
  * test/Makefile: Link FLTK libraries dynamically, notably for games.
    (Done years ago for 1.1, but accidentally missed for 1.3.)

fltk1.3 (1.3.4-9) unstable; urgency=medium

    #920459, which accidentally recurred in one release.  (See #921294.)

fltk1.3 (1.3.4-8) unstable; urgency=medium

  * configure: Revert local changes in favor of using dh_autoreconf.
  * configure.ac: Use (PKG_PROG_)PKG_CONFIG per Helmut Grohne.
  * debian/*-none*: Formally renamed from debian/*-noconfig* and tweaked
    correspondingly to account for running cmake via dh_auto_configure,
    which supplies -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=None.
  * debian/control:
    - Add a versioned Build-Depends-Indep entry for texlive-latex-extra to
      avoid (long)tabu lossage from #920459.  (Closes: #921294.)
    - Standards-Version: 4.3.0 (fully compliant at this point).
  * debian/rules:
    - Allow (dh_)autoreconf after all, albeit with autoheader suppressed.
    - Run cmake via dh_auto_configure per Helmut Grohne's suggestion;
      account for formal side effects of gaining -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=None.
    - Use /usr/share/dpkg/{architecture,buildflags}.mk instead of calling
      dpkg-{architecture,buildflags} directly (and piecemeal).
    - Specify a host-specific pkg-config per Helmut Grohne, both in FTCONFIG
      and in the environment.  (Together with the configure.ac change,
      closes: #900190.)
    - Strip all -f*-prefix-map=* flags from fltk-config.  (See #909078.)
    - override_dh_installchangelogs: Install CHANGES as NEWS(.gz), not
      changelog(.gz).

fltk1.3 (1.3.4-7) unstable; urgency=medium

  * debian/compat: Advance to 11.
  * debian/control:
    - Advance debhelper Build-Depends version constraint to (>= 11~).
    - Rules-Requires-Root: no (confirmed not to affect binary packages).
    - Vcs-{Browser,Git}: Move to salsa.debian.org.
    - Standards-Version: 4.1.3 (already compliant).
  * CMake/FLTKConfig.cmake.in: Never redeclare fluid, which
    FLTK-Targets.cmake already declares.  (Closes: #892979.)
  * debian/rules:
    - Address FTCBFS, based on a patch from Helmut Grohne
      for fltk1.1 (see #887636).
      + Avoid configuring during clean.
      + Do not pass build architecture compiler to cmake or configure.
      + In arch-only builds, limit coverage of test/ to the three targets we
        specifically need for fltk1.1-games.  (Many of the others involve
        trying to run freshly built fluid.)
    - Pass "/usr/bin/pkg-config freetype2" off as FTCONFIG (in lieu of
      freetype-config, which is now deprecated) (see #892341).
    - Set DEB_BUILD_MAINT_OPTIONS more readably.
    - Use ?= for DEB_HOST_(MULTI)ARCH.

  * debian/fix-fltk-targets-noconfig: Escape some left braces meant to be
    taken literally, for compatibility with Perl 5.26.  (Closes: #871059.)
  * debian/rules:
    - Run dh --without autoreconf.  FLTK uses a hand-maintained configh.in
      and an autoheader-unfriendly configure.ac, breaking autoreconf
      (which runs by default as of compat 10).
    - Implement nodoc support, required as of Policy 4.0.0.
  * Standards-Version: 4.0.1 (now compliant).

fltk1.3 (1.3.4-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * New upstream release (technically 1.3.4-1, since upstream replaced the
    original 1.3.4 release with a respin featuring improved Visual Studio
    solution files and a slightly altered version number).
  * KNOWN_BUGS.html: Comment out privacy-violating favicon link.
  * debian/control:
    - Retire explicit libfltk1.3-dbg package in favor of automatic -dbgsym
      packages.
    - Canonicalize with the help of cme fix.  In particular, declare
      Standards-Version: 3.9.8 (already compliant, not that cme checked).
  * debian/copyright: Reflect current reality.
    - HTTPS copyright-format URL.
    - Real source URL (http-only, alas).
    - Update copyright details for FLTK and (unused) convenience libraries.
  * debian/fluid.install, fluid/Makefile: /usr/share/mime/packages/fluid.xml
    has superseded /usr/share/mimelnk/application/x-fluid.desktop.
  * debian/libfltk1.3-dev.install: +/usr/include/FL/abi-version.h.
  * debian/libfltk1.3(-dev).docs: Install new documentation files:
    KNOWN_BUGS.html (and auxiliary html directory) to libfltk1.3,
    README.abi-version.txt to libfltk1.3-dev.
  * debian/libfltk1.3.symbols: Update per new release.  A few symbols changed,
    but all were private.
  * debian/rules:
    - Reflect current exported CMake configuration --
      FLTK-Targets(-noconfig).cmake now wind up in .../share/fltk (though
      libfltk1.3-dev continues to install all .cmake files to /usr/lib/fltk),
      and there's a new static FLTK-Functions.cmake.
    - Actually place common-build-stamp in debian/.
    - Drop the fltk-config.unhardened business, which proved insufficient.
      (Do, however, postprocess fltk-config to avoid emitting the
      -fdebug-prefix-map=... flag intended to *improve* reproducibility!)
    - Configure --with-optim=... so fltk-config --optim won't claim -Os.
    - Stop collecting debug symbols in an explicit libfltk1.3-dbg package.
  * debian/watch: Accommodate upstream version suffixes like -1.
  * debian/.gitignore: Drop libfltk1.3-dbg.
  * documentation/Makefile: Use date -u for full reproducibility.
  * fltk-config.in: Filter out -D*, -f*, and -W*, not just -g* and -O* (but
    leave --optim output alone for reference.)  (Closes: #828081.)
  * .gitignore: Drop fltk-config.unhardened.
  * Sourceful upload resynchronizes all architectures.  (Closes: #850924.)

fltk1.3 (1.3.2-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * fltk-config.in: Fix --ldflags output to reinstate -lX11 (to account for
    potential calls to XCreatePixmap via the fl_create_offscreen macro) and to
    omit the explicit -L flag, as the script's automatic filtering of standard
    directories doesn't account for multiarch paths.  (Closes: #713933.)

fltk1.3 (1.3.0-8) unstable; urgency=medium

  * debian/rules:
    - Keep hardening flags out of the installed fltk-config by adding an
      extra configure run with them disabled and using the resulting
      fltk-config.  (Closes: #677705.)
    - Explicitly use hardened CPPFLAGS.

  * debian/rules:
    - Enable full hardening.
    - Pass hardened LDFLAGS to configure as DSOFLAGS too.  (Closes: #663276.)
  * debian/source/options: rename to (git-only) local-options, so any
    source patches from NMUs will wind up in separate files.
  * test/Makefile: link the threads demo with LDFLAGS, not CXXFLAGS!

fltk1.3 (1.3.0-6) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/copyright: update to copyright-format 1.0.

  * debian/libfltk1.3-{forms,gl,images}.symbols: likewise make
    .symbols.gcc46 contents optional everywhere.  (The lists exactly match.)

fltk1.3 (1.3.0-2) experimental; urgency=low

  * debian/*.symbols:
    - Clean up stray ~gcc44 version suffixes.
    - Properly mark symbols specific to builds with GCC 4.6 (the default
      on most platforms nowadays) or 4.4 (still default on ia64 and sparc),
      with the help of new debian/*.symbols.gcc{44,46} files.

fltk1.3 (1.3.0-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * New upstream release; no longer a snapshot, but still uploaded to
    experimental for now because fluid 1.3 will require formal changes to
    some .fl files per http://www.fltk.org/str.php?L2259.
  * debian/*.symbols: Update accordingly, eliding detailed history.
    (Treat unversioned dependencies as sufficient for symbols present as
    of the first snapshot that entered Debian in early October, and
    nominally require 1.3.0 for anything introduced afterwards.)
  * debian/rules: Configure --with-links, which is no longer the default,
    but remains necessary for libfltk1.3-compat-headers.
  * debian/control:
    - Simplify Build-Depends-Indep to doxygen-latex.
    - Prepare for the libjpeg 8 transition by build-depending on, and
      having libfltk1.3-dev suggest, the virtual libjpeg-dev package.
    - Declare Standards-Version: 3.9.2.  (Already compliant.)
  * debian/fltk1.3-doc.lintian-overrides (new): tolerate Doxygen-supplied
    jquery.js per #630982.
  * debian/copyright: Update years.
  * debian/watch: Resteer to official releases, only available in .gz form.
  * .gitignore: Additionally ignore documentation/fltk.pdf.
  * Build for multiarch.
    - debian/FLTK{Config,Libraries-noconfig}.cmake: add .in extensions and
      un-hardcode the library directory.
    - debian/compat: Advance to 9.
    - debian/control: Advance build dependency on debhelper to (>= 8.1.3).
      Add Multi-Arch: same and Pre-Depends: ${misc:Pre-Depends} for
      libfltk*1.3 and Multi-Arch: foreign for fluid, libfltk1.3-compat-headers,
      fltk1.3-doc, and fltk1.3-games (likely overkill in some cases).
    - debian/libfltk*1.3*.install: Match multi-arch paths.
    - debian/rules: Pass a multi-arch libdir to configure, and substitute it
      in *.cmake.in (which however remain in /usr/lib/fltk for now).

  * debian/libfltk1.3-dev.docs: update per upstream README.* reorganization.
  * debian/FLTKConfig.cmake: belatedly set FLTK_CAIRO_FOUND to TRUE.
  * debian/FLTKLibraries-noconfig.cmake: trim stated dependencies,
    particularly for shared libraries.
  * debian/control: promote some suggestions to recommendations:
    - fluid -> fltk1.3-doc (for the help browser)
    - libfltk1.3-dev -> fluid (few users entirely hand-craft UIs)
    - libfltk1.3-dev -> libglu1-mesa-dev | libgl-dev (for <FL/glu.h>)
  * Thanks to Yuri D'Elia for suggesting that I review the above three files.
  * src/fl_font_xft.cxx: revert XFT->core name mapping, which upstream has
    implemented in a slightly different fashion.
  * debian/rules: enable "CP936" (GBK) CJK encoding support.
  * debian/fluid.lintian-overrides: retire per upstream fluid.desktop
    simplification.

fltk1.3 (1.3~r7794-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * New upstream snapshot.
  * debian/watch: belatedly update for the 1.3 branch and snapshots thereof.
  * debian/copyright: convert to machine-readable DEP-5 format and note that
    licensing isn't entirely uniform (but that most exceptions pertain to
    convenience copies of libraries that Debian builds refrain from using).
  * debian/libfltk1.3.symbols: update to reflect recent changes.
  * src/fl_font_xft.cxx (load_xfont_for_xft2): map the usual XFT aliases
    to corresponding typical core font family names, as proposed in
    http://www.fltk.org/str.php?L2215.

fltk1.3 (1.3~r7710-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * New upstream source base, from the UTF-8-based 1.3 branch.
    (Closes: #229702.)
  * Update per new SONAMEs (libfltk*.so.1.3).
  * Split shared libraries into individual packages.
  * Split compatibility header links into their own package, rather than
    (ab)using Debconf.  [Translators, sorry to discard your contributions.]
    (Closes: #196003, LP: #267486.)
  * debian/copyright:
    - Update list of major contributors per CREDITS.
    - Note extension of upstream copyright through 2010.
  * debian/compat: advance to 8, as it is safe to do so.
  * debian/control:
    - Advance debhelper requirement to (>= 8) per the above.
    - Advance dpkg-dev requirement to (>= 1.15.7) for dpkg-buildflags.
    - Generally clean up relationships; don't worry about anything pre-etch,
      and wildcard the build-dep on libasound2-dev to [linux-any].
    - Update B-D-I per switch from htmldoc to doxygen and LaTeX.
    - Build-depend on libcairo2-dev and pkg-config for (new) Cairo support;
      likewise, arrange for -dev package to suggest libcairo2-dev.
    - Set Vcs-* fields to point to (new) personal git.d.o repository.
    - Declare compatibility with Policy version 3.9.1.
  * debian/rules:
    - Obtain baseline {C,CXX,LD}FLAGS from dpkg-buildflags rather than
      relying on them to be in the environment courtesy of dpkg-buildpackage.
    - Stop passing -D_REENTRANT, which is not only obsolete but redundant.
    - Adjust (along with .docs, .doc-base, and .manpages files) for new
      documentation layout and build procedure.
    - Update (along with .cmake and -dev.links files), per new CMake setup
      (not directly used, but exposed via -dev package).
    - Drop redundant configure flags; add --enable-cairo and update .symbols
      file accordingly.  (Not using --enable-cairoext at this point; Cairo
      support remains experimental, and fully enabling it would yield a
      dependency cycle between libfltk.so.1.3 and libfltk_cairo.so.1.3.)
    - Set CAIROLIBS to just -lcairo; FLTK doesn't directly use libpixman-1.
  * cairo/Makefile:
    - Link shared libraries against $(CAIROLIBS).
    - Fix install target to make relative symlinks.
  * configure(.in): allow -ldl into LIBS after all, as libfltk now uses it.
  * debian/source/{format,options,patch-header}: advance to 3.0 (quilt),
    albeit in single-debian-patch mode per VCS use, for .orig.tar.bz2 support.
  * fluid/fluid.desktop: replace the Exec command (which used cd) with a Perl
    one-liner for compatibility with more desktop environments. (LP: #569518.)
  * debian/fluid.lintian-overrides: adjust accordingly.
  * debian/fluid.NEWS: new; note change in handling empty functions per
    http://www.fltk.org/str.php?L2259 and how to compensate for it.
  * fltk-config.in: strip -[gO]* from --c(xx)flags output. (LP: #606032.)
  * test/Makefile: link XDBE-using apps (color_chooser, image, list_visuals,
    and tiled_image) against -lXext for compatibility with gold.
  * debian/libfltk1.3-dev.docs: new; install README.{123,CMake_use,cairo}.
  * debian/fltk1.3-doc.examples: deploy new upstream examples subtree.
  * (debian/).gitignore: Direct git to ignore content generated during build.

  * debian/FLTKConfig.cmake: belatedly advance FLTK_VERSION_PATCH to 10.

    artificial debian/CMakeCache.txt discussed in #553264.

fltk1.1 (1.1.10~rc2-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release candidate.
  * debian/copyright: extend date range through 2009.
  * fluid/*: revert i18n patch (#333401); although I still support the
    general idea, it proved problematic in practice.  (Translated strings
    weren't always properly isolated to the GUI, and the only translation
    wasn't actively maintained anyway.)
  * debian/fluid.install: update accordingly.  (No more fluid.mo.)
  * Update Spanish Debconf translation, thanks to Franciso Javier Cuadrado.
    (Closes: #513692.)  Apologies for the delay; the submission was slightly
    late for lenny, and as such no longer merited an upload on its own.
  * debian/control:
    - List ${misc:Depends} in Depends across the board, as future Debhelper
      versions could conceivably generate content for it.
    - Clean up Section fields: libfltk1.1 is already implicitly in libs, and
      libfltk1.1-dbg is in the newfangled debug section nowadays. ;-)
    - Advance Standards-Version to 3.8.3.  (No further changes required.)
    - Require debhelper (>= 7.0.50) for further rules simplification.
  * debian/rules:
    - On alpha, lock in a version of 1.1.10~rc2 for symbols introduced when
      building with GCC 4.3, which is now the default on that platform too.
    - Simplify further per debhelper 7.0.50+'s override_dh_* support.

    strip symbols introduced when building with 4.3 regardless of actual
    compiler version so that when the transition occurs, the generated
    dependencies will be suitably tight.

    white (or nearly white) foreground; revert to honoring the user's
    background choice as well in such cases.  (Closes: #484660.)

    introduced a handful of new symbols.

    they are sufficiently generic that the Debian packages err on the side
    of caution by prepending fl.)
  * Further streamline all executables' shared-library dependencies.
  * Move .desktop files to /usr/share/applications, as /usr/share/applnk
    is deprecated and KDE-only.  (Closes: #444063)
  * Run dh_icons for fluid and fltk1.1-games, also per #444063.
  * Modernize games' .desktop files' Categories settings as well.
  * Drop gratuitous (and typo-ridden) DEB_DH_SHLIBDEPS_ARGS setting.
  * fltk-config(.in) --compile: link FLTK dynamically.  (Closes: #441141.)
  * Declare home page centrally (per dpkg 1.14.6) rather than in descriptions.
  * Accommodate the (atypical) possibility of multi-word CC and CXX settings.
  * Declare those inter-package dependencies that need to be tight with
    ${binary:Version} rather than the deprecated ${Source-Version}.
  * Modernize fluid's Debian menu section (Apps -> Applications).
  * Expand debian/copyright; in particular, clarify that licensees have
    the option of applying newer LGPL versions (than v2.0).
  * Drop old workaround for #365085 in favor of simply requiring a new
    enough cdbs.

fltk1.1 (1.1.7-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * configure(.in), {src,test}/Makefile: drop unnecessary hardcoded
    dependencies on libXext, zlib, and libGLU, per Nathanael Nerode's
    patch; inaugurate libfltk1.1-dev's NEWS.Debian with a suitable entry.
    (Closes: #405233.)
  * debian/po/es.po: new Spanish translation for libfltk1.1-dev, courtesy
    of César Gómez Martín <cesar.gomez@gmail.com> and Manuel Porras

  * debian/po/it.po: new Italian Debconf translation for libfltk1.1-dev,
    thanks to Andrea Bolognani <eof@kiyuko.org>.  (Closes: #358191.)
  * Merge in more fixes from the 1.1 branch, whose likelihood of seeing
    another upstream release is highly uncertain; bump shlibs requirement
    because these add two new public methods.
  * (Build-)depend directly on libgl(u)1-mesa-dev by default (but keep
    the alternate [build-]dependencies on virtual packages, of course).
  * Install fluid-32.xpm, and use it as fluid's menu icon.
  * Move up to debhelper compatibility level 5, and make use of cdbs
    0.4.37's automatic -dbg package handling.

fltk1.1 (1.1.7-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release; among many other things:
    - Fixes nonsensical sentence in documentation.  (Closes: #341747.)
    - Documents new foreground()/background() paradigm.  (Closes: #343550.)
  * Enable (newly added) Xinerama support and add an appropriate build
    dependency.
  * Build with the default GCC version on all architectures, as g++-4.0 no
    longer suffers from bug #336463 as of revision 4.0.2-4.  (Closes: #342965.)
  * Generally resynch and tidy up debian/rules.
  * Rework installation slightly, and install fluid's new .desktop files.
  * Update version info in pregenerated FLTKConfig.cmake, and stop shipping
    a redundant copy of FLTKUse.cmake now that it's materialized upstream.
  * Extend fluid's internationalization to the two new fluid-generated
    modules (print_panel and template_panel) and attempt (rather
    conservatively, as I know extremely little Spanish) to bring its
    Spanish translation up to date.  Further assistance, and for that
    matter a Spanish Debconf translation, would be appreciated.
  * Resynch with upstream SVN as of Jan. 31, which just adds some belated
    bugfixes.
  * Make fltk-config(.in) list indirect dependencies only for
    --ldstaticflags (vs. --ldflags), and accordingly downgrade most of
    libfltk1.1-dev's dependencies to suggestions.

    UTF-8 throughout rather than in a hodgepodge of national encodings.

    Siddall <clytie@riverland.net.au>.  (Closes: #314172.)
  * debian/*: C++ transition.  (Closes: #317539.)
    - libfltk1.1c102 renamed back to libfltk1.1, as no package by that
      name ever appeared in a release; redundant conflicts dropped.
    - Make sure to use a post-transition libglu1c2 such as libglu1-xorg.
  * debian/control: standards-version 3.6.2 (already compliant).

  * debian/libfltk1.1-dev.links: new, for the two header-related links we
    actually want.
  * debian/rules:

  * debian/rules: clear DEB_MAKE_CHECK_TARGET to avoid breaking with
    cdbs >= 0.4.3.

    - set version in shlibs file automatically again.
  * debian/rules.manual: retire.
